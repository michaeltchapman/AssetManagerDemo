# Advanced UE 4/5 Asset Manager Demo 

This is a little demo of the Unreal Asset Manager, showing a couple of strategies that help when working with large numbers of assets.

My preference when working with Unreal is to manage things automatically where possible, require clicking in the UI to set data as little
as possible, prefer data-only blueprints, and (ab)use strict naming schemes where I can.

## Setup

Create new ue5 project with c++ enabled

## Asset Manager settings

TODO What do all the settings actually do

## Start wth PrimaryAssetLabel

## Move the directory parsing new Primary Asset class

## Add bundle name control

## Add regex control

## Add post processing

## Get data off the CDO and use for markup (FGameplayTagContainer)
